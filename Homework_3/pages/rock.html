			even in the most distant ones. Despite the immense popularity and importance of this art movement, many people do not
			think about what styles and genres of music exist. This article discusses the TOP-10 musical directions,

			experts will always be popular despite many years.

		<p>
			<strong>Rock music</strong>- a generalized name for a number of areas of popular music.<u> The word rock (translated from English - "rock", "rock", "swing") </u>
			originated as an abbreviation for the name of rock and roll, chronologically the first genre of rock music, and denotes rhythmic sensations characteristic of rock and roll,
			associated with a certain form of movement, by analogy with <i> roll, twist, swing, shake </i>. Most often (but not necessarily) rock is performed with
			using electric guitars and drums. It is typical for rock musicians to perform compositions of their own composition.
			However, these elements in themselves do not yet make music rock, and therefore the belonging of some styles of music to rock is disputed.
