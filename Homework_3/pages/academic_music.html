			<strong>Academic music (serious music, secular professional)</strong> - music that is in relation to the continuity, first of all, to the formed
			in Europe in the XVII-XIX centuries. musical genres and forms (opera, symphony, sonata, etc.), melodic and harmonic principles and instrumental composition.
			In certain specific cases, the conflict of academic composers of the 20th century, especially those belonging to the avant-garde movements
			(for example, John Cage or Karlheinz Stockhausen), with the musical tradition of the past can be very sharp, but this is precisely the conflict
			(extremely tense dialogue), while other types of modern music - from pop music to jazz - from classical European music
			tradition almost do not interact.
			
			However, certain experiments on crossing academic music with various other traditions were undertaken throughout the 20th century:
			from a hybrid of classical and jazz created by George Gershwin to recordings accompanied by a symphony orchestra (symphonic jazz),
			the use of a symphony orchestra in rock music (symphonic rock, symphonic metal, symphonic black metal, etc.) or with other borrowed
			among the "academics" elements of performance practiced by many rock bands.
			
			In a broader sense of the word, academic music can be considered the one that is written, performed and studied among musicians with an academic
			musical education that developed in the 20th century from classical musical traditions, but significantly deviated from them towards rational
			principles of organizing musical material.
