			<strong>Sacred music</strong> - musical works related to texts of a religious nature, intended to be performed as during a church service,
			and in everyday life. Sacred music in the narrow sense means church music of Christians; in a broad sense, sacred music is not limited to accompaniment
			worship and is not limited to Christianity. The texts of sacred music compositions can be both canonical (for example, in W.A. Mozart's Requiem), and free
			(for example, in motets by Guillaume de Machaut), written on the basis or under the influence of sacred books (for Christians - the Bible)
