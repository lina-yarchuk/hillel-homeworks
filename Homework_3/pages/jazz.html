			involving elements of African American folklore.

			Jazz as a phenomenon originated in the 1910s in the southern United States and quickly spread to all developed countries.

			Popular music and jazz in the 1920s became almost identical concepts for many people, while American critics,
			primarily opposed to the commercial music industry in the United States.

			destabilized by the swing boom and be-bop movement. Its modern meaning emerged in the 1950s when jazz was consolidated into a musical genre,
			with a description that combined different styles of all time periods.
			Most varieties of the genre are characterized by swing, vocal expression, improvisation, reliance on riffs, use of frets with blues notes
