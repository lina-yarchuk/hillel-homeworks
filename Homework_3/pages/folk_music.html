			<strong>Musical folklore, traditional music</strong> - musical and poetic creativity of the people, integral
			part of folk art, which, as a rule, exists in oral form, passed down from generation to generation.
			Since folk music is known to all socio-historical formations (both oral and written),
			then it should be considered not only as a component of folk art, but also, in a broader sense, as a branch (root)
			musical art. One of the main branches, which is usually compared to popular and academic music.
			There is also a definition of the term "folk music" - traditional music of a particular people or culture.
			Music folklore studies folk music. Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) was one of the first scientists
			describing folk music from a theoretical point of view. He, like other early researchers, pointed to a direct connection between
			folk music and nature. In the 19th century, folk music was considered, if not "the music of nature", then at least natural,
			natural music, unaffected by urban influences.
			Researchers of that time considered mainly the following questions:
			is there a connection between classical and folk music, and are traces of the origins and forms of folk music found
			in language or movement. Of the greatest importance in understanding folk music were musical and ethnographic studies carried out by
			under the guidance of the American philologist Francis James Child (1825-1896) in Great Britain and the Hungarian composer and
			folklorist White Bartok (1881-1945) in Eastern Europe
